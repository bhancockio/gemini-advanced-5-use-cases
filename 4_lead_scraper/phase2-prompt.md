You have already identified at least 10 related Skool communities and compiled their basic information (Community Name, Community URL, Creator, and Description) in CSV format. Now, we are going to enhance this data by adding the creators' social media contact details. We will break this task into three sequential parts. **IMPORTANT:**  
- Work only with the communities from Phase 1 (do NOT revisit the seed community).  
- For each contact detail, perform multiple independent searches and only include valid, real results.  
- If a valid detail cannot be found after extensive searches, mark it as "N/A".

-----------------
Part A: Creator Email Discovery
-----------------
For every community in the CSV, perform the following steps to find the creator's email address:
1. Use multiple Google searches with these sample queries:
   - "`<creator name> email`"
   - "`<community name> email`"
   - "`<creator name> contact`"
   - "`<creator name> official website email`"
2. Look on the community's official website, About page, or social media profiles.
3. **Include the email only if it is valid** (i.e., it contains "@" and a proper domain) and publicly available.
4. If repeated searches do not yield a valid email, mark it as "N/A".

Once finished, update your CSV by adding a new column named "Creator Email."

-----------------
Part B: Creator LinkedIn URL Discovery
-----------------
After all emails have been found, proceed to search for each creator's public LinkedIn profile URL:
1. Use multiple, independent Google searches with queries such as:
   - "`<creator name> LinkedIn`"
   - "`<creator name> profile LinkedIn`"
   - "`<community name> founder LinkedIn`"
2. **IMPORTANT:** Do not simply generate a URL by concatenating names. Use Google search to locate the actual profile.  
3. Verify that the URL is valid (e.g., it should typically start with "https://www.linkedin.com/in/" or "https://www.linkedin.com/company/") and that it points to a real, public profile.
4. If no valid LinkedIn URL is found after several attempts, mark it as "N/A".

Once completed, update your CSV by adding a new column named "Creator LinkedIn URL."

-----------------
Part C: Creator Twitter/X URL Discovery
-----------------
Finally, search for each creator's public Twitter/X profile URL:
1. Use multiple, independent Google searches with queries such as:
   - "`<creator name> Twitter`"
   - "`<creator name> X`"
   - "`<creator name> official Twitter`"
2. **IMPORTANT:** Again, do not simply piece together a URL from the creator's names. Verify the search results so that the URL comes from twitter.com or x.com and points to an active, genuine profile.
3. If no valid Twitter/X URL is found after multiple searches, mark it as "N/A".

Once finished, update your CSV with a new column named "Creator Twitter/X URL."

-----------------
Final Data Compilation
-----------------
After completing Parts A, B, and C, your final CSV should include the following columns (in this exact order):
   - Community Name
   - Community URL
   - Creator
   - Creator Email
   - Creator LinkedIn URL
   - Creator Twitter/X URL
   - Description

Each row must correspond to one unique community (excluding the seed community). Use "N/A" for any detail that couldn't be validated.

-----------------
Additional Guidelines
-----------------
- Focus solely on gathering and validating publicly available information.
- Validate all URLs and email addresses through multiple independent sources, using Google (or another reputable search engine).
- The final CSV output should be cleanly formatted and ready for use in subsequent outreach campaigns.

Proceed with the above steps to update your CSV with the correct, validated social media account details for each community creator.
