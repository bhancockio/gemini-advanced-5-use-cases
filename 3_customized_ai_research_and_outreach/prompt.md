You are tasked with researching YouTube channels for an AI-led outreach campaign. Follow the instructions below carefully:

1. **Seed Analysis:**  
   - Analyze the provided seed channel by reviewing its previous videos.
   - Identify the niche, content style, and coaching or actionable advice elements that define the channel.

2. **Channel Discovery:**  
   - Using the characteristics of the seed channel as a reference, search on Google and YouTube for 10 other channels that share a similar niche and style.
   - **Criteria:**  
     - Each channel must have at least 5,000 subscribers.
     - They should provide actionable advice and have a coaching element in their content.
     - **IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the channel represents a personal brand (run by an individual or a small team) and is not a corporate account from a large company (e.g., Nvidia, Google, Nike, etc.).
   - For each candidate channel, verify that it meets the criteria.

3. **Data Collection for Each Channel:**  
   - **Contact Information:**  
     - Find the public contact information associated with the channel. This could be an email address, a LinkedIn profile, or an X account (formerly Twitter), among other methods. Start with the channel's "About" section. If not available there, check related websites or video descriptions.
   - **Content Insights:**  
     - Review the last three videos on the channel.
     - Summarize the topics, style, and any coaching/advice elements evident in these videos. Use these details to personalize the outreach message.

4. **Generate a Custom Outreach Message:**  
   - Based on your research for each channel, create a custom outreach message template that can be used via email, LinkedIn, or X. The message should:
     - Introduce the concept clearly: "Hey, I have a website where your users can chat with your YouTube content!"
     - Explain that the service integrates the channel's content into a custom website chat widget.
     - Emphasize that there is no upfront setup fee and it costs only $99/month.
     - Educate the channel owner about how this platform can seamlessly extend their coaching and actionable advice, helping their audience engage deeper with the content.
     - Include a clear call-to-action (e.g., scheduling a demo or a call).
     - Be informative, friendly, and professional; focus primarily on educating the recipient about the benefits.
     - Tailor the language of the message to the specific insights gathered from the channel's recent content and fit the appropriate platform (email, LinkedIn, or X).

5. **Output Format:**  
   - For each of the 10 channels found, provide the following details:
     - Channel name.
     - Number of subscribers.
     - Contact information (email, LinkedIn, or X account as available. Include notes on where this information was found).
     - A brief summary of the channel's focus based on the last three videos.
     - The personalized outreach message template tailored to that channel's content.
   - Ensure that each outreach message is personalized using insights gathered from the channel's recent content.

**Additional Guidance:**  
   - Use your best judgment on toneâ€”aim for an educational style that informs the channel owner about how their audience will benefit from engaging with their content via this chat website.
   - If certain contact information (like an email address) isn't readily found, include a note mentioning the alternative method (LinkedIn or X), and suggest checking the 'About' section or linked websites.
   - Provide your output in a clear, structured format so that a human reviewer can easily assess the identified channels along with the associated custom outreach messages.
