# Local Business SEO Analysis with Gemini Advanced

## Objective:
Utilize Gemini Advanced's powerful Google Search and Google Maps tools to perform a detailed, multi-source, data-driven SEO analysis for a local business. The goal is to generate a value-packed, lead magnet report filled with actionable insights and advanced recommendations from the world's best SEO expert. This comprehensive report should not only diagnose current SEO performance but also offer concrete, measurable steps for improvement.

## Instructions:

1. **Business Name Integration:**
   - Start the report with the real business name provided, eliminating any placeholders. Integrate the business name consistently in the header, business overview, and throughout the analysis.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - **Google Search Analysis:**
     - Use multiple Google search queries (e.g., "official website [BUSINESS_NAME] meta title", "site:[BUSINESS_NAME] homepage SEO") to retrieve detailed website information.
     - Extract key on-page SEO data such as the meta title and meta description. Record their precise character counts.
     - Gather additional quantitative metrics where available (e.g., number of indexed pages, URL structure details, technical SEO indicators).
   - **Google Maps Analysis:**
     - Perform several searches on Google Maps to collect detailed local information:
       - Full business address
       - Google Maps star rating (e.g., 4.7/5), total review count, and number of photos
       - Contact details such as phone number and website
     - Confirm data accuracy by comparing results from multiple searches.

3. **SEO Analysis:**
   - **Website SEO Findings:**
     - **Meta Information:** Display the meta title and meta description along with their exact character lengths.
     - **Technical & On-Site SEO:** Assess header tag usage (H1, H2, etc.), keyword integration, internal linking, canonical tags, and URL structure. Indicate any missed opportunities.
     - **Performance Metrics:** Recommend running page speed tests (via Google PageSpeed Insights or similar) and note if the load time exceeds 3 seconds. Provide actionable insights regarding image compression, JavaScript/CSS minification, and caching strategies.
     - **Structured Data & Schema Markup:** Check for existing structured data; if absent or outdated, recommend implementing local business schema to enhance rich snippet appearance.
   - **Local SEO Findings:**
     - **Google My Business (GMB) Summary:** Present detailed GMB data including star rating, review count, photo count, verified address, phone number, and opening hours.
     - **Local Citations:** Verify the business’s presence in key local directories (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor, Bing Places) and note any inconsistencies in NAP (Name, Address, Phone).
     - **Customer Sentiment:** Summarize user review trends using numerical data (e.g., average rating, review volume) and highlight any recurring positive or negative feedback.

4. **Report Generation:**
   - **Header Section:** Begin with the actual business name clearly at the top.
   - **Business Overview:** Provide a concise summary of the business, highlighting its unique selling proposition, location, core services, and relevant contact details.
   - **SEO Analysis Breakdown:**
     - Organize findings into two sections:
       - **Website SEO Findings:** Include hard data points (e.g., meta title length, page load speed score) alongside qualitative analyses such as header tag structure and keyword integration.
       - **Local SEO Findings:** Detail GMB metrics, review statistics, photo count, and findings on local directory listings.
   - **Actionable Recommendations:**
     - Provide 4-6 specific, data-backed recommendations that reflect expert-level SEO insights. For example:
       - "Shorten the meta title and meta description to optimal limits (e.g., under 60 characters for titles and 160 characters for descriptions) to avoid search result truncation."
       - "Improve page load times by optimizing images, enabling browser caching, and minifying CSS/JS—aim for a load time under 3 seconds."
       - "Implement structured data (local business schema) to enhance rich snippets and improve click-through rates."
       - "Ensure NAP consistency across all local citations by updating listings on Yelp, TripAdvisor, Bing Places, and other relevant directories."
       - "Conduct a comprehensive header tag analysis and adjust H1-H6 structures to reinforce key SEO signals."
       - "Develop a customer review strategy to increase positive reviews and overall review count across GMB and other platforms."
     - Ensure that each recommendation clearly ties back to the data collected.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Generate the complete SEO analysis report in clean markdown format.
   - Verify that the report is free of placeholder text by replacing [BUSINESS_NAME] with the actual business name throughout.
   - The final report should be concise yet rich in actionable insights, making it an irresistible lead magnet for potential clients.

**Proceed with the analysis for the business: [BUSINESS_NAME]**
