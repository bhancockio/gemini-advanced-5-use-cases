# YouTube Content Analysis and Shortform Blog Post Creation - Ghostwriter Edition

## Objective:
As my ghostwriter, your task is to use the verified introductory transcript (from file 2a) of my latest video to create two shortform blog-style posts that capture the essence of the video’s introduction. These posts should reflect my personal voice, highlight key insights, and motivate my audience to watch the full video—all while following the tone and style of the example provided below.

## Instructions:

1. **Review the Verified Transcript:**
   - Examine the exact introductory transcript from the latest video (provided in file 2a).
   - Extract the core concepts, key hooks, and primary promise presented in the introduction:
     - Identify the main challenge or topic I introduce.
     - Note the value propositions or solutions I offer.
     - Capture any catchy phrases, numbers, or metrics that grab attention.

2. **Content Repurposing:**
   - **Section 1: Short Social Post**
     - Write a brief and impactful post that encapsulates the essence of the introduction.
     - Use clear, concise language and include bullet points or numbers if needed.
     - End with a straightforward call-to-action encouraging viewers to watch the full video.
  
   - **Section 2: Detailed Social Post**
     - Write a more elaborated post that provides context, summarizes the key insights, and includes my personal analysis.
     - Structure the post with clear paragraphs and line breaks, mirroring the style of my previous posts.
     - Conclude with a persuasive call-to-action that encourages readers to watch the full video.

3. **Style and Tone Example:**
   - Here is an example of a previous post to help you capture my tone and style:
     ```
     Just finished testing o3-mini vs DeepSeek-r1.

     Here’s the winner for each task type:

     1️⃣ Build a new project from scratch
     o3-mini – the increased input and output context window allows this model to build amazing apps in a single shot

     2️⃣ Build a new feature from scratch
     DeepSeek – the model needed multiple reminders about what we’re trying to accomplish. After that, it crushed it!

     3️⃣ Refactor existing code and create tests
     o3-mini – In this experiment, DeepSeek dropped multiple important functions and made the decode completely unusable. Refactor with DeepSeek at your own risk.

     Tomorrow, I’ll record a video for you guys covering everything you need to know about these models, walk you through the tests, and show you the model performances.

     I’ve uploaded all the prompts and my thoughts on the results on GitHub—you can check everything out in the meantime.
     ```

4. **Output Requirements:**
   - **Format:** The final output must be in markdown.
   - **Structure:**
     - **Section 1:** The Short Social Post.
     - **Section 2:** The Detailed Social Post.
   - Avoid excessive use of emojis or hashtags—focus on clear, direct language that reflects my voice.
   - Ensure each section is clearly labeled and formatted with appropriate line breaks and bullet points.

**Proceed by analyzing the verified introductory transcript from file 2a and generating these two shortform blog posts accordingly.**
